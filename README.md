# Microservices

Quick Introduction to Microservices
1. Introduction to Spring Cloud
  - Microservices
    - REST
    - & Small Well Chosen Deployable Units
    - & Cloud Enabled
1. Challenges with Microservices - Bounded Context — What is the right context/ boundary for your micro service? - Configuration Mangement — How to simplify all the configurations that you would have to manage. - Dynamic Scale Up and Scale Down — How to dynamically scale up and down, and dynamically distribute the load among the active instances. - Visibility — We want to have great visibility into what’s happening behind the scenes with each of these micoservices. How to determine which micro service was the cause for a defect. How do you know if all the micro services are up and running.  - Pack of Cards — How to prevent one micro service being down taking down the entire application. How to build fault tolerance into the micro service.
